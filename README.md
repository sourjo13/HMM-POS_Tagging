# HMM-POS_Tagging

Data

For this assignment, youâ€™ll use the Treebank dataset of NLTK with the 'universal' tagset. The Universal tagset of NLTK comprises only 12 coarse tag classes as follows: Verb, Noun, Pronouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Determiners, Cardinal Numbers, Particles, Other/ Foreign words, Punctuations.

 

Note that using only 12 coarse classes (compared to the 46 fine classes such as NNP, VBD etc.) will make the Viterbi algorithm faster as well.

Goals

You can split the Treebank dataset into train and validation sets. Please use a sample size of 95:5 for training: validation sets, i.e. keep the validation size small, else the algorithm will need a very high amount of runtime.

 

You need to accomplish the following in this assignment:

    Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
    Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. Note that to implement these techniques, you can either write separate functions and call them from the main Viterbi algorithm, or modify the Viterbi algorithm, or both.
    Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
    List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger and got corrected after your modifications.
